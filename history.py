st.text('''Initial Struggle: As a college student facing mounting academic pressure, Cirillo found himself overwhelmed, unfocused, and prone to severe burnout.
The 2-Minute Test: He made a small pact with himself: challenge his focus for just two consecutive minutes using a mechanical, tomato-shaped kitchen timer—pomodoro being the Italian word for tomato.
Finding the Sweet Spot: After successfully maintaining focus for tiny intervals, he experimented with longer durations. He deduced that shorter intervals (like 10 minutes) were too brief to accomplish meaningful tasks, while hour-long blocks caused fatigue.''')
